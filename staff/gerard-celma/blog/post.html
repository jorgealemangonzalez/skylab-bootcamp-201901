            <p>The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. This should be interesting. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Damage report! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Your head is not an artifact! Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years?</p>
